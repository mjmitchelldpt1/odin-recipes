Odin recipe project on basic HTML

During the writing of this I am working on CS50 course and TOPS.  I have a rudimentary understanding of HTML, CSS and JS and need more understanding to manipulate CSS and JS to finish my CS50 work.  After this project I will demonstrate basic HTML structure including linking, writing, and images without styling at this time. `
